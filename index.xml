      <description>&lt;p&gt;I miss &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon&#34; title=&#34;StumbleUpon&#34;&gt;StumbleUpon&lt;/a&gt; days in the early 2000s when discovering new things on the internet was a constant Joy. While browsing hacker news I randomly landed on an interesting website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.recommendmeabook.com/&#34; title=&#34;Recommend me a book&#34;&gt;Recommend me a book&lt;/a&gt;. The premise as they explain on the website is very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Some how i stumbled across this great essay by Richard P. Gabriel called Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big. In this article Gabriel talks about Worse is better a design philosophy for software development.
This pretty much matches the process i have tried to follow while building Practo. I am putting it here as a reminder for myself to stay true to all these points -
 Simplicity – the design must be simple, both in implementation and interface.</description>

      <description>Simple is better than complex
 One of the biggest problem that makes code complex is almost all of us are coding for the future. Ask yourself how many times you started writing a new feature and added things you thought will be needed later. Now think how many times you were thankful for them.
Yagni requires you to write code that is needed today, most of the times it will help you keep things simple.</description>
